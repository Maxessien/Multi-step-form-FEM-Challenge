## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SCSS

## What I learned

Working on this multi-step form helped reinforce my knowledge of:

- DOM manipulation
- Step-by-step navigation logic
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design techniques

Hereâ€™s a sample of the JavaScript logic I used for navigating between steps:

```javascript
const nextBtn = document.querySelector(".next-btn");
nextBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  currentStep++;
  showStep(currentStep);
});
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving in the areas of accessibility and state management. In future projects, I want to explore using a JavaScript framework like React to handle component-based logic more efficiently.
